                <p>There are a number of methods that you can use to lay out your web pages and applications. MDN contains a number of in-depth guides to the different methods, and this page provides an overview of them all.</p>
                <h2>Normal flow, block, and inline layout</h2>
                <p>If you are not using a flex or grid layout, then your content is laid out using normal flow, or block and inline layout. These guides will help you to understand the way this layout method works.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Block_and_inline_layout_in_normal_flow">
                <header>Block and inline layout in normal flow</header>

                <div>
                    <p>In this guide, we will explore the basics of how Block and Inline elements behave when they are part of the normal flow.</p>
                    <p>Normal Flow is defined in the CSS 2.1 specification, which explains that any boxes in normal flow will be part of a formatting context. They can be either block or inline, but not both at once. We describe block-level boxes as participating in a block formatting context, and inline-level boxes as participating in an inline formatting context.</p>
                    <p>The behavior of elements which have a block or inline formatting context is also defined in this specification. For elements with a block formatting context, the spec says:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"In a block formatting context, boxes are laid out one after the other, vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block. The vertical distance between two sibling boxes is determined by the 'margin' properties. Vertical margins between adjacent block-level boxes in a block formatting context collapse.</p>
                        <p>In a block formatting context, each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block (for right-to-left formatting, right edges touch)." - 9.4.1</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>For elements with an inline formatting context:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"In an inline formatting context, boxes are laid out horizontally, one after the other, beginning at the top of a containing block. Horizontal margins, borders, and padding are respected between these boxes. The boxes may be aligned vertically in different ways: their bottoms or tops may be aligned, or the baselines of text within them may be aligned. The rectangular area that contains the boxes that form a line is called a line box." - 9.4.2</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Note that the CSS 2.1 specification describes documents as being in a horizontal, top to bottom writing mode. For example, by describing vertical distance between block boxes. The behavior on block and inline elements is the same when working in a vertical writing mode, and we will explore this in a future guide on Flow Layout and Writing Modes.</p>

                <header>Elements participating in a block formatting context</header>
                <p>Block elements in a horizontal writing mode such as English, layout vertically, one below the other.</p>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout/Block_and_Inline_Layout_in_Normal_Flow/mdn-horizontal.png" alt="An image showing Inline Direction and Block Direction in horizontal writing mode">
                <p>In a vertical writing mode then would lay out horizontally.</p>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout/Block_and_Inline_Layout_in_Normal_Flow/mdn-vertical.png" alt="An image showing Inline Direction and Block Direction in vertical writing mode">
                <p>In this guide, we will be working in English and therefore a horizontal writing mode. However, everything described should work in the same way if your document is in a vertical writing mode.</p>
                <p>As defined in the specification, the margins between two block boxes are what creates separation between the elements. We see this with a very simple layout of two paragraphs, to which I have added a border. The default browser stylesheet adds spacing between the paragraphs by way of adding a margin to the top and bottom.</p>

                <p>By default block elements will consume all of the space in the inline direction, so our paragraphs spread out and get as big as they can inside their containing block. If we give them a width, they will continue to lay out one below the other - even if there would be space for them to be side by side. Each will start against the start edge of the containing block, so the place at which sentences would begin in that writing mode.</p>

                <header>Margin collapsing</header>
                <p>The spec explains that margins between block elements collapse. This means that if you have an element with a top margin immediately after an element with a bottom margin, rather than the total space being the sum of these two margins, the margin collapses, and so will essentially become as large as the larger of the two margins.</p>
                <p>In the example below, the paragraphs have a top margin of <code class=inline-code>20px</code> and a bottom margin of <code class=inline-code>40px</code>. The size of the margin between the paragraphs is <code class=inline-code>40px</code> as the smaller top margin on the second paragraph has collapsed with the larger bottom margin of the first.</p>

                <p>Inline elements display one after the other in the direction that sentences run in that particular writing mode. While we don't tend to think of inline elements as having a box, as with everything in CSS they do. These inline boxes are arranged one after the other. If there is not enough space in the containing block for all of the boxes a box can break onto a new line. The lines created are known as line boxes.</p>
                <p>In the following example, we have three inline boxes created by a paragraph with a <code class="inline-code">&lt;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong" target="_blank">strong></a></code> element inside it.</p>

                <div class="CSS_example">
                    <div id="CSS_example_box_5">
                        <p>Before that night—<strong>a memorable night</strong>, as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”</p>

                </div>

                <p>The boxes around the words before the <code class="inline-code">&lt;strong></code> element and after the <code class="inline-code">&lt;strong></code> element are referred to as anonymous boxes, boxes introduced to ensure that everything is wrapped in a box, but ones that we cannot target directly.</p>
                <p>The line box size in the block direction (so the height when working in English) is defined by the tallest box inside it. In the next example, I have made the <code class="inline-code">&lt;strong></code> element 300%; that content now defines the height of the line box on that line.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="The_display_property_and_flow_layout">
                <header>The display property and flow layout</header>
                <p>In addition to the rules existing in CSS2.1, new levels of CSS further describe the behavior of block and inline boxes. The <code class="inline-code"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display">display</a></code> property defines how a box and any boxes inside it behave. In the CSS Display Model Level 3, we can learn more about how the <code class="inline-code">display</code> property changes the behavior of boxes and the boxes they generate.</p>
                <p>The display type of an element defines the outer display type; this dictates how the box displays alongside other elements in the same formatting context. It also defines the inner display type, which dictates how boxes inside this element behave. We can see this very clearly when considering a flex layout. In the example below I have a <code class="inline-code"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" target="_blank">&lt;div></a></code>, which I have given <code class="inline-code">display: flex</code>. The flex container behaves like a block element: it displays on a new line and takes up all of the space it can in the inline direction. This is the outer display type of <code class="inline-code">block</code>.</p>
                <p>The flex items however are participating in a flex formatting context, because their parent is the element with <code class="inline-code">display: flex</code>, which has an inner display type of <code class="inline-code">flex</code>, establishing the flex formatting context for the direct children.</p>

                <div class="CSS_example">
                    <div id="CSS_example_box_7">
                        <div>Flex Item</div>
                        <div>Flex Item</div>
                        <div>Children are in normal flow</div>
                    </div>

                    <code class="code_example">
                        .container {
                            <br>
                            <span class="indent">display: flex;</span>
                            <br>
                        }
                        <br>
                        .container > * {
                            <br>
                            <span class="indent">border: 1px solid green;</span>
                            <br>
                        }
                    </code>

                    <code class="code_example">
                        &lt;div class="container">
                        <br>
                            <span class="indent">&lt;div>Flex Item&lt;/div></span>
                            <br>
                            <span class="indent">&lt;div>Flex Item&lt;/div></span>
                            <br>
                            <span class="indent">&lt;div></span>
                            <br>
                                <span class="indent_dbl">&lt;div>Children&lt;/div></span>
                                <br>
                                <span class="indent_dbl">&lt;div>are in&lt;/div></span>
                                <br>
                                <span class="indent_dbl">&lt;div>normal flow&lt;/div></span>
                                <br>
                            <span class="indent">&lt;/div></span>
                            <br>
                        &lt;/div>
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>Therefore you can think of every box in CSS working in this way. The box itself has an outer display type, so it knows how to behave alongside other boxes. It then has an inner display type which changes the way its children behave. Those children then have an outer and inner display type too. The flex items in the previous example become flex level boxes, so their outer display type is dictated by way of them being part of the flex formatting context. They have an inner display type of flow however, meaning that their children participate in normal flow. Items nested inside our flex item lay themselves out as block and inline elements unless something changes their display type.</p>
                <p>This concept of the outer and inner display type is important as this tells us that a container using a layout method such as Flexbox (<code class="inline-code">display: flex</code>) and Grid Layout (<code class=inline-code>display: grid</code>) is still participating in block and inline layout, due to the outer display type of those methods being <code class="inline-code">block</code>.</p>

                <h2>Changing the Formatting Context an element participates in</h2>
                <p>Browsers display items as part of a block or inline formatting context in terms of what normally makes sense for that element. For example, a <code class="inline-code">&lt;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong" target="_blank">strong></a></code> element is used to highlight a word and displays bold in browsers. It would not generally make sense for that <code class="inline-code">&lt;strong></code> element to be displayed as a block level element, breaking onto a new line. If you did want all <code class="inline-code">&lt;strong></code> elements to display as block elements, you could do so by setting <code class="inline-code">display: block</code> on <code class="inline-code">&lt;strong></code>. This means that you can always use most of the semantic HTML elements to markup your content, and then change the way it displays using CSS.</p>

                <p>In this guide, we have looked at how elements display in normal flow, as block and inline elements. Due to the default behavior of these elements, an HTML document with no CSS styling at all, will display in a readable way. By understanding how normal flow works you will find layout easier, as you understand the starting point for making changes to how elements are displayed.</p>
